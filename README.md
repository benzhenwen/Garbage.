# Garbage
Garbage is a simple game made for my Enlgish multi-modal design project.

## Running
Click on releases on the right side of the github page and download the appropriate build depending on your platform.

For windows, that would be "Windows.zip", then unzip the downloaded folder and run garbage.exe.

## Building
This project is built using Godot 4.3.

Clone this repo and open the project file through Gogot's import feature. You are welcome to run the main.tscn scene from the editor or build it yourself.

## Known issues
Improper text sizing on Lunix causes icons to be misaligned.
