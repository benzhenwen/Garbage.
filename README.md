# Garbage
Garbage is a simple game made for my Enlgish multi-modal design project.

## Running Online
This project can be found at https://benzhenwen.itch.io/garbage

The web build contains some issues with viewport sizing that are not planned to be fixed.

## Running Locally
Click on releases on the right side of the github page and download the appropriate build depending on your platform.

For windows, that would be "Windows.zip", then unzip the downloaded folder and run garbage.exe.

## Building
This project is built using Godot 4.3.

Clone this repo and open the project file through Gogot's import feature. You are welcome to run the main.tscn scene from the editor or build it yourself.

## Known issues
Text misaligned with side icons in some cases
